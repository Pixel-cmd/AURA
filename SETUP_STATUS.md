# 🎯 Setup Status - What's Done & What's Next

## ✅ What I've Already Set Up

1. **✅ Project Repository**
   - Connected to GitHub: `https://github.com/Pixel-cmd/AURA`
   - All documentation created (README, SETUP guides)

2. **✅ Node.js Installer**
   - Downloaded Node.js v20.11.0 installer
   - Opened installer for you to complete

3. **✅ Setup Scripts Created**
   - `auto-setup.sh` - Automated Expo setup (ready to run)
   - `install-setup.sh` - Full installation script
   - `QUICK_START.md` - Step-by-step guide

4. **✅ Xcode Tools**
   - Command line tools already installed ✅

## 🔄 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Complete Node.js Installation
The installer window should be open. If not, run:
```bash
open /tmp/node.pkg
```

**In the installer:**
1. Click "Continue" through the welcome screen
2. Accept the license
3. Choose installation location (default is fine)
4. Click "Install" (you'll need your Mac password)
5. Wait for installation to complete
6. Click "Close"

### Step 2: Restart Terminal
After installation, **restart Cursor's terminal** or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
In Cursor's terminal, run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers. If you see "command not found", restart Cursor completely.

## 🚀 What Happens Next (Automatic)

Once Node.js is installed, **just tell me** and I'll automatically:

1. ✅ Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
2. ✅ Install all dependencies:
   - Expo SDK
   - React Navigation
   - Location services
   - Authentication libraries
   - Notifications
   - State management (Zustand)
   - All iOS development tools
3. ✅ Set up project structure
4. ✅ Configure for iOS development
5. ✅ Verify Git/GitHub connection
6. ✅ Create initial app structure

**Then you'll be ready to:**
- Run `npx expo start`
- Open iOS simulator
- Start building your app!
